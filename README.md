## NXTeleManager
TeleManager is a modern interface for interacting with telemetry in more efficient, more useable ways. TeleManager automatically stores references to every line created through it, allowing it to manage those lines and updates to them
later on without the instantiating class needing to worry about maintaining objects on the telemetry stack. TelemetryManager serves mainly to create and continually update captions and as easy access to various different logging methods within basic telemetry.
